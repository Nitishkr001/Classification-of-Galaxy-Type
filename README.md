# Galaxy Type Classification With Sub-categorization Using Deep Learning Framework #

## Our team include:<br>Aryan Kamat<br>Aditya Phatak<br>Nitish Kumar Pathak

 The project involved galaxy categorization utilizing machine learning and image 
processing techniques, emphasizing Galaxy Zoo and 
Galaxy10 datasets. The MobileNetV2 architecture is used for 
feature extraction on a training dataset of 4100 labeled photos. 
At the same time, image pre-processing procedures ensure 
dataset standardization. After 20 epochs, the model reaches 
an overall accuracy of 91%, indicating its usefulness in 
categorizing galaxies into Elliptical, Spiral, and Irregular 
types, as well as detailed subclassifications such as E0, E3, E7 
for elliptical galaxies and Normal Spiral, Barred Spiral for 
spiral galaxies. The subclassification models use image 
processing to extract morphological traits, demonstrating the 
possibility for automated study of astronomical information 
and contributing to advances in astrophysics research.
